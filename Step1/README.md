# A Quick Brush Up on Behave

The following is a small, incredibly unrealistically simple Behave test to help you brush up on it. If you’ve never used Behave before, it’s probably best that you go back and make sure you have a fair understanding of how to run a given/when/then test.

You don’t need to know anything advanced, but just the basics are a prerequisite. So go do that. I’ll wait..



Just make these tests pass. Link below. If you need to look at the solution; it’s either poorly written (come find me) or you haven’t learnt enough. Go back.

This test is really simple. You have a class that takes in 2 int values. One number higher than the other. The lowest of the numbers are then changed to either remain lower than the higher one initially set, equal to it or greater than it. Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to validate that I’m not talking out of my ass and test what I say it does with the feature provided.

Done? Great! You're all caught up.

# Selenium_Behave_Tutorial
A short introduction to using Selenium with Behave

This is a short internal introduction to using Selenium alongside Behave. It's purpose isn't a 'best practices' guide to
using the library, but is designed to get new testers up and running and, at best, confident in being able to troubleshoot
and expand their knowledge of the framework on their own as they see fit.

## How to use this Guide.

This repository contains the source code for the introduction doc and needs to be followed alongside it. On their own
each doc/repo is quite lax when it comes to context but can be looked back on after going through the docs at least once,

If that's not the case, this was poorly designed and you need to come find me (@AlysonNgonyama on Slack. I won't give you
my email, I probably won't respond).

Each folder is a 'Step' or section in the docs.

# Feedback and Contributions

I suspect that this training doc will evolve and improve as time passes and feedback is offered and changes to our 
use of Selenium evolves at DotModus.

If you find something cool, feel free to add it here and make a PR. Share you discoveries and make our working with
Selenium a great... a less painful experience in our testing.

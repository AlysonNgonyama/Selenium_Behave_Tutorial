# Running Behave Alongside Selenium

Running Behave alongside Selenium is relatively simple and can be seen as being exactly the same as running Behave and then Selenium.

Making this work is a combination of running Selenium methods that interact with a website inside the body of each step. Use any of Selenium’s functionality to figure out how to progress through the test in the code/ directory.

To run the application, you’ll have to open a separate terminal, navigate to the `Running_Behave_algonside_Selenium/webserver/` directory and run 
```
	python3 app.py
```
… to start up the test server/website you’ll be doing this test against.

And that’s about it. If you feel like throwing in the towel, the solutions are in the solutions/ directory, but tread lightly; we’ll know if you never finished..

HINT: Inspecting the web page will give you interesting details to help you with finding really useful xpaths?

Still confused? Here’s the answer; You can look at it here.

Finished?

Congratulations! That marks the end of this little introduction to Selenium with Behave. What you should know by now is how to setup Selenium on your computer and interact with a webpage and it’s elements using Selenium functions and methods.

I’d like to emphasize that this is as intro as it gets. You’ll find yourself having to scour the internet for solutions to problems associated with taming this unruly beast of a library.

Best of luck.
